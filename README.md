Chrome extension for automating your browser experience with "recipes"

Using an array of different services--Twitter, Google Drive, Email, Reddit, SMS and many more, you can share content on multiple platforms instantly. For instance, you can create a recipe for when you find an image you like, post it to Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr simultaneously. Or if your friend asks you a question on Facebook like "Can you explain Heartbleed to me?", you can create a recipe for posting the text to AskReddit.
